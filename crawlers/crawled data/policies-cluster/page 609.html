    <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
    <p>
        Loop Games (“we,” “us” or “our”) takes your privacy seriously. This Privacy policy (“Privacy policy”) explains our data protection policy and describes the types of information we may process when you use one or more of our mobile applications (the “App”, “our App”) and explains how we and some of the companies we cooperate processing that information.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we refer to personal data (or personal information) we mean any information of any kind relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a natural person who can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his or her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social status.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our Privacy policy applies to all users, and others who access the App (“Users”). If you do not want us to collect, store, use or share your information in the ways described in this Privacy Policy, you should not play our apps or use our services.
    </p>

        For the purposes of the GDPR, we are the data controller.
    </p>

WHEN YOU USE THE APP, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE APP, YOU AGREE TO PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA WHICH IS PROVIDED TO US IN LINE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</strong></p>
    <p>
        Most of the information that we collect about you comes directly from you when you play our Apps or 
        interact with third party ads in our Apps or with our ads in other publisher’s apps. These information 
        are collected through SDKs (Software Development Kits) which are technical tools integrated into our Apps. 
        In general, the information we collect about you relates to the type of device you are using, information that helps 
        us identify your device, how you play our apps and may include information that you submit to us when you voluntarily 
        contact us or which you allow us to access when you connect to your social network accounts through our Apps. We may 
        also collect information from app store platforms and partners and other third parties such as information about your 
        interests and in-app purchases (provided that we never receive your payment or credit card information). We will 
        sometimes use third party advertising companies to help us collect this data. Further information is provided below 
        in the section titled "Third party advertising companies".
    </p>
    <p><strong>TECHNICAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
    <p>
        We collect technical information about your device that are necessary for you to use our App and additional technical 
        data that enables us to maintain and analyze the functioning of the App, to personalize the content of the App, and 
        to display advertisements. Such information includes amongst others the type of device(s) you are using to play our 
        Apps, persistent identifiers, such as IP address, device identifiers, ad identifiers, unique user ID specific for our 
        Apps, and the country or region that you are playing in.
    </p>

    <p><strong>ADVERTISING AND APPLICATION USAGE INFORMATION</strong></p>
    <p>
        When you use our Apps, we collect additional information from you by using persistent identifiers that permit identification 
        of your device. We collect information about how you play our Apps, how you interact with our ads in other publisher’s apps 
        and how you interact with third party ads that are shown to you in our Apps. Such information is used for delivering and 
        improving our service, advertising, cross-promotion and analytics purposes.
    </p>

    <p><strong>CLASSICAL PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>

        and you can use our Apps without providing us with your classical personal information. We will receive your classical
         personal information (such as you name, address, email or phone number) only when you contact us directly and will use 
         such information only to respond to your inquiry. We may ask you to submit and we may process other non-personally identifiable
          information that may be personal to you such as your age range, year of birth and gender, provided that year of birth and gender

    </p>

    <p><strong>OPTING OUT OF GEOLOCATION</strong></p>
    <p>
        If you have previously allowed us to access your geolocation data and you no longer wish for us and our service providers to collect and use GPS location information, you may disable the location features on your device. Please see your device manufacturer settings. Please note that if you disable such features, you will not be able to access or receive some or all of the services, content, features, and/or products made available via the Services.
    </p>

    <p><strong>OPTING OUT OF PUSH NOTIFICATIONS</strong></p>
    <p>
        When you install our apps on your mobile device you can choose to receive push notifications, which are messages an app sends you on your mobile device even when the app is not on. You can turn off notifications by visiting your mobile device’s “settings” page.
    </p>

    <p><strong>OPTING OUT OF THIRD PARTY TAILORED ADVERTISING</strong></p>
    <p>
        We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on the device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests in apps on your mobile device, you may opt-out by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device. You can also reset the “Advertising Identifier” (like an IDFA) from your mobile device’s settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous “Advertising Identifier.” In addition, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s “AppChoices” app, that offer to provide you with control regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for tailored advertising. Like the opt-out tools mentioned above for web, these mobile opt-out tools are provided by third parties, not Loop Games. Loop Games does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that you may still receive advertisements from third parties within Loop Games apps even if you opt-out of tailored advertising, but they will not be based on your activity across unrelated web sites or apps.
    </p>

    <p><strong>OPTING OUT OF COOKIES</strong></p>
    <p>
        You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer or limit the type of cookies you allow.

    </p>
