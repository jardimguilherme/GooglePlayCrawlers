We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy contained herein, and we will use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>

					<h4>4. Other companies and public authorities</h4>
					<p>We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information to, exchange such information with companies and organizations or provide such information to public authorities if required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with all and any applicable laws, or where it is pursuant to we are required to respond to a governmental, regulatory, administrative or court order or directive, a subpoena or a search warrant, or to combat fraud and illegal activity.</p>
