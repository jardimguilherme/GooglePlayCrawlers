                considered public or that you have designated as public in your user profile settings.

                You have the right to receive your personal data that you have provided us in a structured,
                commonly used and machine readable format and the right to transmit that data to another

            <p>
                Right to Make Complaint: if you consider that our processing of your personal data
                infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a
                supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member

            <p>
                If you have any concerns about the way we process your personal data, you are welcome to contact
                our data protection officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@firecraftstudios.com">
                    privacy@firecraftstudios.com
                </a> or write to us at the address
                set forth in the “Contact Firecraft Studios” section. We will look into your request and make
                good faith efforts to resolve any concern you may have.

            <p><strong>6. Security Safeguards</strong></p>
            <p>
                Firecraft takes reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access
                or against loss, misuse or alteration by third parties. Although we make good faith
                efforts to store the information collected on the Services in a secure operating environment
                that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that
                information during its transmission or its storage on our systems. Further, while we attempt
                to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our
                security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining access to this
                information. We do not warrant or represent that your information will be protected against,
                loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties. No method of transmission over the Internet, or
                method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its
                absolute security.
            </p>
            <p><strong>7. Data Retention</strong></p>
            <p>
                Firecraft retains your personal data for as long as needed to provide you Services,
                unless we are required by law to delete or if Firecraft accepts your request to delete
                the information. We will also retain and use your personal data as necessary to comply with
                our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
            </p>
            <p><strong>8. Our Policy Regarding Children</strong></p>
            <p>
                We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from anyone under the age of 16 or
                knowingly allow such persons to use our Services. If you are under 16, please do not send
                any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email
                address. No one under the age of 16 may provide any personal data. In the event that we learn
                that we have collected personal data from a child under age 16, we will delete that information
                as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child
                under the age of 16, please contact us.
            </p>
            <p><strong>9. Transfer of Personal Data Outside Your Country</strong></p>
            <p>
                We may transfer information that we collect about you to affiliated entities, or to other
                third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or
                jurisdictions around the world. Please note that these countries and jurisdictions may not
                have the same data protection laws as your own jurisdiction, and we take steps to ensure
                adequate safeguards are in place to enable transfer of information to the U.S. and the use
                and disclosure of information about you, including personal data, as described in this Policy.
            </p>
            <p><strong>10. Lawful Basis for Processing</strong></p>
            <p>
                On certain occasions, we process your personal data when it is necessary for the
                performance of a contract to which you are a party, such as to provide the Services
                to you. We may also process your personal data to respond to your inquiries concerning
                our products and services.
            </p>
            <p>
                On other occasions, we process your personal data where required by law. We may also
                process your personal data if necessary to protect your interests or the interests of a third party.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, we process your personal data when necessary to do so for fraud prevention,
                improving our network and services, and marketing our services to advertisers and publishers;
                where these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no other lawful basis for such
                processing, we will generally ensure that consent has been obtained from you. You have the
                right to withdraw your consent to processing of personal data at any time.
            </p>
            <p>

                Firecraft is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives under the
                Privacy Shield Framework and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent
                on its behalf. Firecraft complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers
                of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability
                provisions.

                security or law enforcement requirements.

                These additional provisions for California consumers apply only to individuals who reside in California.

                with the subject line “California Rights Request.” We will need to verify
                your identity before processing your request. In order to verify your identity,
                we will generally require the matching of sufficient information you provide us
                to the information we maintain about you in our systems. In certain circumstances,

            </p>
            <p>
                CCPA gives you a right to direct a business that sells your personal information
                to stop selling your personal information and to refrain from doing so in
                the future. We do not sell any of your personal information and will require our
                service providers not to sell your personal information.
                <br>
                You also have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights listed above.

                authorized agent with written permission to act on your behalf and (ii) you successfully
