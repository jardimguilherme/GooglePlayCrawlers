            <p>We process personal data for our legitimate interests of ensuring that any use of the Online Services is lawful and non-fraudulent, does not disrupt the operation of our services, does not harass our staff or other individuals, to enforce our legal rights and also in order to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
            <p>Where we reasonably believe that you are or may be in breach of any applicable laws or our terms of use, we may use your personal information to inform relevant third parties such as your law enforcement agencies about the content.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any User Content posted by you constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights, or of their right to privacy. You may not copy, download, or embed any User Content without the express written permission of the content owner. You may not use any User Content for any commercial purposes, or any public performances.</p>
            <p>We work with Apple and Google to assist us with fraud prevention and the detection of any illegal activity (e.g. to verify in-app purchases made through iTunes and Google Play).</p>
            <h4>5. DATA SHARING</h4>
            <p><strong></strong></p><center><strong>We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy</strong></center><p></p>
            <p><u>Group members, personnel, suppliers or subcontractors:</u> We keep your information confidential, but may disclose it to any member of our group (which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the Companies Act 2006), our personnel, suppliers or subcontractors insofar as it is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. However, this is on the basis that they do not make independent use of the information, and have agreed to safeguard it.</p>
            <p><u>Merger or acquisition:</u> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, any third party to which we sell or transfer our assets to will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p><u>Required by law:</u> In addition, we may disclose your information to the extent that we are required to do so by law (which may include to government bodies and law enforcement agencies); in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings; and in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention).</p>
            <p><u>Enforcement:</u> We may also disclose your personal information to third parties in order to enforce or apply the terms of agreements, to investigate potential breaches, or to protect the rights, property or safety of FTG, our customers, or others.</p>
            <p><u>Digital Content Stores:</u> Where the Games are downloaded though Google Play, iTunes and/or Amazon Appstore, we may disclose your personal information to Google, Apple and/or Amazon respectively for the purposes of facilitating any in-Game payments made through these platforms.</p>
            <p><u>Support Centre</u>: We use a third party platform provider called Zendesk to manage any support requests, queries and issues raised by users via the Support Centre or sent to <a href="mailto:support@ftgames.com">support@ftgames.com</a>. Further details about the way in which Zendesk may collect and process your information can be found in their terms <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/company/customers-partners/master-subscription-agreement/">here</a>.</p>
            <h4>6. AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING</h4>
            <p><strong></strong></p><center><strong>We use automated decision making methods which do not involve human involvement to process your information only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy</strong></center><p></p>
            <p>We process your personal information via automated decision making methods in order to identify users who are suspected of cheating in the Games. Our automated decision making methods are designed to detect cheating by looking out for (i) excessive currency stores against actual completed gameplay; and (ii) excessive content against actual purchases made and completed gameplay.</p>
            <p>If users are determined to be or suspected of cheating the following actions may be taken and which will be unknown to the user:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>an increase in the number of advertisements displayed within the Games; and</li>
              <li>an increase in the frequency of suspected cheats playing against other suspected cheats.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may block users from the Games and/or the Online Services who are determined to be cheating following an automated decision process. In this scenario the user will be notified of the outcome and will have the right to obtain human intervention to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision to block access to the Games and/or the Online Services.</p>
            <h4>7. CONSUMER CONTROL AND OPT-OUT OPTIONS</h4>
            <p>If you do not wish to be part of a lookalike campaign or receive notifications from us you can opt-out by changing your advertising and notification settings on your device directly.</p>
			<p>You can opt-out from analytics performed by Adjust <a href="https://www.adjust.com/opt-out/">here</a>.</p>
            <p>You can withdraw your consent to targeted advertising by changing your advertising settings on your device at any time.</p>
			<p>You can opt-out of any personalised in-game discounts and offers through the options settings provided in our Games.</p>

              <li>we no longer need to process that personal data for the reason it was collected;</li>
              <li>we are processing that personal data because it is in the public interest or it is in order to pursue a legitimate interest of FTG or a third party, you don’t agree with that processing, and there is no overriding legitimate interest for us to continue processing it;</li>

              <li>If you request, we will supply you with the relevant personal data in CSV format.  Where it is technically feasible, you can ask us to send this information directly to another IT system provider if you prefer.</li>

              <li>If you do not agree with the way we have processed your data or responded to your concerns, an alternative is to submit a complaint to a Data Protection Supervisory Authority.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>9. DATA RETENTION</h4>
            <p>We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant service, or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

The servers we use for this purpose are hosted by Amazon Web Services.</p>
