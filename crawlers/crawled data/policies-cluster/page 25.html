      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>iDailybread Bible apps, applications owned and operated by iDailybread.org, know you care how information about you is used and shared. We hope the following statements will help you understand how we will collect, use and protect the information you provide to us on our app.
</p>
<p></p><h3>What we collect and how we use it</h3><p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information you provide<br>
When you sign up for an iDailybread Bible app account that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). We may combine the information you submit under your account, with information from third parties to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may allow you to opt out of combining such information.</li>
      <li>Unique Device ID and GPS location<br>
When you access an iDailybread Bible app, we may collect your Unique Device ID ('UDID') and/or IP address and/or GPS location. We use this information to provide a tailored experience for you. The information is collected in order to determine the aggregate number of unique devices using our service or parts of our service, to track total usage, analyse data, and communicate with you more effectively. We may combine this information with information from third parties to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our service. We do not share any personally identifiable information with third parties in association with your UDID or GPS location without your explicit permission.</li>
  <li>User communications<br>
Personal information or requests that you submit will be sent to the group administrator. The group administrator and/or one of their members will have access to this information. When you send email or other communication to us, we may retain those communications to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.</li>
<li>
Third party sites<br>
We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our website for their own use and subject to their own privacy policies. These companies collect and use non-personally identifiable information during your time in the app in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p><h3>How do we use your information?</h3><p></p>

<p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we would like to use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. You may decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case we may not be able to provide those services to you.</p>

<p></p><h3>How do we protect your information?</h3><p></p>

<p>We do not share your personal information with other institutions without your explicit consent. We may share your personal information only if it has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms Of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of us, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorised access to or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. including internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorised access to systems where we store personal data. Unless explicit permission is obtained from you, we restrict access to personal information to its employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>

<p></p><h3>Data Integrity</h3><p></p>

<p>We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p>

<p></p><h3>Accessing and updating personal information</h3><p></p>

<p>When you use our service, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate service purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardise the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal information.</p>

<p></p><h3>Enforcement</h3><p></p>

<p>We periodically review our compliance with this Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints regarding privacy issues, it is our policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between us and an individual.</p>

<p></p><h3>Questions</h3><p></p>
